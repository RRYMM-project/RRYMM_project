    <h1>Hello Maaria, Yulia, Rami and Riku</h1>
    <p>Let's start!</p>
    <h2>How to work with PULL REQUESTS</h2>
    <p>Before creating a PR, you should be working in a separate branch, not the main branch (e.g. main or master).</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Create a new branch in your repository in Visual Studio: <b>git checkout -b your_new_branch</b></li>
        <li>Make changes to your project files</li>
        <li>Add and commit the changes: <br>
            <b>git add .</b> <br>
            <b>git commit -m "Your comment on the changes"</b>
        </li>
        <li>Submit the branch to GitHub: <br>
            <b>git push origin your_new_branch</b></li>
    </ol>

    <p>2. Create a Pull Request on GitHub</p>
        <p>Go to your GitHub repository.</p>
        <p>GitHub will automatically show you a message that you have just uploaded a new branch. You will see a "Compare & pull request" button.</p>
        <p>If you don't see this message, click on the "Pull Requests" tab and click on "New pull request".</p>
        <p>Select your branch to compare with the main branch (e.g. main).</p>
        <p>Add a title and description for your PR. The description should be short and clear, explaining what exactly has changed and why these changes are needed.</p>
        <p>For example:</p>        
        <p>Title: Added new functionality for error handling.</p>
        <p>Description: This PR adds new functionality for error handling in the login form.</p>
        <p>If you want, you can assign reviewers by clicking on Reviewers on the right.</p>
        <p>Click Create pull request.</p>
